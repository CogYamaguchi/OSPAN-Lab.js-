# Operational Span Task for Lab.js

This respository hosts an operational span task, a popular experimental paradigm to measure working memory capacity in cognitive psychology. For online data collection, the task needs to be integrated into Qualtrics. Insert the url:

in a sruvey. See the instructions [here](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/deploy/3a-qualtrics.html) as to how you can integrate into a Qualtrics survey.

The task is created based on Foster et al. (2014). 

> Note that Foster et al. adjusted response deadline for the math problems for each participant according to the average response time on practice trials, but the current task does not impose any response deadline.
